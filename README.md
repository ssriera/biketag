Angelhack (Austin May 2015) 

The site is about finding a mystery location in Austin with a recognizable location. To play, bike to the location in the photo, take a photo of your bike at that location, and then bike to a new mystery location within 30 minutes of finding the previous one. From there, take a photo of your bike in front of a significant landmark and another biker will be able to claim it.
